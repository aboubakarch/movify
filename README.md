# Getting Started Movify

This project is by using ReactJs,Redux and TMDB.

## Steps To Run The Project

1. Run `yarn install` or Simply `yarn` to install dependecies
2. Run `yarn start` to start application

## Available Pages

- Home Page or Index Page `/`
- Movie Detail Page `/movie/movieId`

### Extra Work

- I've added and extra section on home page to display top 4 highest rated movies in term of average rating.
- Also added skelton to display loading animation.

### Note!

I didn't add `.env` file in `.gitignore` because there I've added api key which you need while testing the project.
